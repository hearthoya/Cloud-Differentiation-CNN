# Cloud-Differentiation-CNN
An implementation of a CNN that uses Tensorflow to differentiate between Cirrus and Cumulonimbus clouds. Inspired by  Nicholas Renotte's video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jztwpsIzEGc&amp;pp=ygUdaG93IHRvIGNyZWF0ZSBhIENOTiBpbiBweXRob24%3D&amp;ab_channel=NicholasRenotte

Unzip the data folder to have access to the dataset. Add new jpgs called cirrustest or cumulonimbustest to test with your own images.

Enjoy :)
