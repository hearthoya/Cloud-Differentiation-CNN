# Cloud-Differentiation-CNN
An implementation of a CNN that uses Tensorflow to differentiate between the 11 cloud classes in Harvards CCSNv2 cloud dataset. Inspired by  Nicholas Renotte's video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jztwpsIzEGc&amp;pp=ygUdaG93IHRvIGNyZWF0ZSBhIENOTiBpbiBweXRob24%3D&amp;ab_channel=NicholasRenotte

Uses opencv-python, tensorflow, numpy and a few other packages

Unzip to access to the dataset. Add new jpgs called "test.jpg" to the root folder to test with your own cloud images.

Enjoy :)
