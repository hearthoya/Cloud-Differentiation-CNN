# Multiclass-Cloud-Classification-CNN
A Python CNN made that uses Tensorflow to differentiate between 11 classes of cloud. Inspired by Nicholas Renotte's video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jztwpsIzEGc&amp;pp=ygUdaG93IHRvIGNyZWF0ZSBhIENOTiBpbiBweXRob24%3D&amp;ab_channel=NicholasRenotte.
Packages used are tensorflow, numpy, opencv-python, matplot lib and a few others. I used the Harvard CCSN v2 cloud dataset to train, test and validate this model but you could use any images of clouds or anything else as long as they fit the labels you create.

Enjoy :)
